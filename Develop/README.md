# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

The Work Day Scheduler is a dynamic web page that allows you to add tasks, events, meetings, ect to each hour of the day and have them be saved for the next time you come back to the page. 

- The motivation for creating this schedular is to get practice using local storage, buttons, and to continue developing more complex for loops to create a dynamic web page. 
- I built this project to use my skills developing web pages to solve the issue of needing a calendar schedule my day.
- The project solves the issue of not having a dynamic work day calendar that can be accessed via the internet. 
- What I learned is how to use dynamic webpage tools like jquery, jquery UI, and local storage.
